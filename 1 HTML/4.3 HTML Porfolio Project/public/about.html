<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I graduated from the University of California - Irvine in June 2023 with a
  Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. I am currently learning about full
  stack development and volunteering at Hack for LA to become a well-rounded
  developer. In the future, I would love to learn more about AI/Machine Learning
  since the possibilities with that technology seem endless and it is quite
  awesome to use. I might apply for a graduate program to get a masters degree
  in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and AI. I might
  need to brush up on my math for that.

  During my free time, I love to play Badminton. It is an exciting hobby that
  lets me escape the clutches of my computer screen and give my eyes the rest
  they deserve.

  I love dogs and cats. I also love the color blue. I like to window shop for
  board games rather than playing them. I love to eat korean fried chicken and
  korean barbecue.
